# Pong Game
Welcome to my version of the classic Pong game! In this two-player game, players use paddles to hit a ball back and forth across the screen. The first player to reach a certain number of points  wins the game.

# Getting Started
To play the game, simply run the PongGame.java file in your Java IDE or terminal. You will be presented with a screen that allows you to choose the number of points needed to win the game. Once you have made your selection, click the "Start Game" button to begin.

# How to Play
Player 1 controls the left paddle and uses the W and S keys to move up and down, respectively.
Player 2 controls the right paddle and uses the up and down arrow keys to move up and down, respectively.
The ball will bounce off the walls and paddles, changing direction each time it does so.
If a player fails to hit the ball with their paddle, the other player earns a point.
The game ends when one player reaches the specified number of points.
